    "## Data Science Project: Analyzing and Visualizing a Supermarket Sales Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective** <br>\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the sales data of a supermarket to uncover insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The project will include data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, with optional predictive analysis to forecast sales or categorize customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**\n",
    "- The \"Supermarket Sales\" dataset from Kaggle will be used for this project, provided in CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**\n",
    "1. **Data Collection** <br>\n",
    "- We are using the \"Supermarket Sales\" dataset in CSV format from Kaggle.\n",
    "2. **Data Loading** <br>\n",
    "- Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.\n",
    "3. **Data Cleaning** <br>\n",
    "- Handle missing values appropriately.\n",
    "- Convert data types where necessary (e.g., parsing dates, ensuring numerical columns are correct).\n",
    "- Detect and address duplicates or inconsistencies in the data.\n",
    "- Perform outlier detection and handling to ensure robust analysis.\n",
    "4. **Feature Engineering** <br>\n",
    "- Create new features to enhance analysis:\n",
    "    - Day of the Week: Categorize sales by weekday and weekend.\n",
    "    - Time of Day: Segment sales into morning, afternoon, and evening.\n",
    "    - Discounted Sales: Calculate discounts (if applicable) and analyze their impact.\n",
    "5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** <br>\n",
    "- Generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.\n",
    "- Analyze the distribution of numerical features (e.g., histograms).\n",
    "- Examine the frequency of categorical features (e.g., bar plots).\n",
    "- Create a correlation matrix to understand relationships between numerical variables.\n",
    "- Perform segmentation analysis based on customer demographics, product lines, and branches.\n",
    "6. **Data Visualization** <br>\n",
    "- Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, and/or Plotly to create meaningful visualizations:\n",
    "    - Time Series Analysis: Analyze sales trends over time.\n",
    "    - Branch and City Performance: Visualize sales distribution by branch and city.\n",
    "    - Product Performance: Identify top-performing and underperforming products.\n",
    "    - Customer Demographics: Visualize sales by customer attributes (e.g., gender, age groups if available).\n",
    "    - Payment Methods: Analyze preferences for payment methods.\n",
    "    - Geospatial Analysis (if applicable): Map sales distribution across locations.\n",
    "    - Use advanced visualizations like heatmaps, scatter plots, pie charts, and box plots.\n",
    "7. **Insights and Recommendations** <br>\n",
    "- Derive actionable insights from the analysis:\n",
    "    - Highlight patterns in sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.\n",
    "    - Summarize correlations between variables.\n",
    "    - Suggest strategies for improving sales and operations.\n",
    "8. **Deliverables**\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook: A complete analysis notebook with EDA and visualizations.\n",
    "- Cleaned Dataset: Provide the cleaned dataset for reproducibility.\n",
    "- Presentation/Report: A concise summary of key findings, visualizations, and actionable recommendations.\n",
    "- Interactive Dashboard (Optional): Build an interactive dashboard using Plotly, Tableau, or Power BI."
